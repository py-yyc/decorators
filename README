So kurt's doing a context-manager talk at (next?) PyYYC.

He suggested I do a decorator talk to go along with it. This is stuff
for that.

Things to go over:

 - functions are objects too
 - first-class things!
 - a decorator is a function -- that returns a function

 digression: "continuation"

 - encapsulates state
 - "magic"!
 - show demo
